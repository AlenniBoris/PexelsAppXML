## Pexels App( XML + Compose Version )

Let's imagine that we were given a task that
combines all the beauty and diversity of visual images,
like Pinterest. However, in this version, we propose to create
a platform based on the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/). Users will be able to easily find
inspiring images using the search, and then, when clicking
on each image, view its details.
